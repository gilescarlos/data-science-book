# Machine Learning {#ml}

Machine learning techniques combine methods from statistics and computer science to make predictions and handle significantly large data sets. 

## Supervised Learning

### Regression and Classification

### Naive Bayes

### Nearest Neighbors

### Support Vector machines

### Neural Networks

### Decision Trees

Mention linear regression and logistic regression as discussed in chapter \@ref(stats-methods) are also utilized for regression and classification.

### Ensembles (Bagging, Boosting)

## Unsupervised Learning

### Clustering

### PCA

## Reinforcement Learning
